    Republic&#8217;s Honoured Collective The Belarusian State Chamber Orchestra (BelSCO) was founded in 1968, under
    the name of &#8220;Minsk Chamber Orchestra&#8221;, by a well-known musician Oleg Yanchenko, an organist, composer
    and conductor. For twenty-five years the orchestra was lead by Yury Tzyriuk, who came from the Minsk and
    St.Petersburg (then Leningrad) Conservatories. The highest performing achievements of the ensemble are associated
    with his name.</p>
    <p>In 1975, the orchestra received great accolades at the International Festival of Chamber Orchestras in Vilnius,
        Lithuania, where it was proclaimed to be one of the very best ensembles of the then Soviet Union. In 1977, the
        orchestra won the All-Union competition of the Professional Performing Ensembles. The Chamber Orchestra has
        performed in such halls as the Great Hall of Moscow Conservatoire, The Philharmonic Hall in St. Petersburg, and
        all main halls of the capital of the former USSR. The ensemble received numerous awards, among them &#8211; the
        Honorary Diplomas and Certificates of the Supreme Soviets of Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,
        Moldavia (Moldova) and the republics of Caucasus and Middle Asia.</p>
    <p>In 1977, the State Chamber Orchestra was the very first of all Belarusian professional ensembles chosen to tour
        Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The tour was a resounding success. Since then, the orchestra has toured
        Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Finland, Lebanon, Turkey, and many
        other countries.</p>
    <p>The orchestra enjoys performing extensively in its native Belarus, and there is not a place on the Belarusian map
        where the orchestra has not performed. In fact, BelSCO was instrumental in establishing chamber orchestras in
        many Belarusian cities, such as Hrodna, Brest, Gomel, Molodechno, and others.</p>
    <p>The most outstanding artists who have performed with the orchestra include pianists Sviatoslav Richter, Paul
        Badura-Skoda (Austria), Nikolay Petrov, Tatiana Nikolaeva, Halina Czerny-Stefańska (Poland), Elisso Virsaladze,
        Mikhail Voskressensky; cellists Mstislav Rostropovich, Natalia Gutman; violinists Victor Tretyakov, Liana
        Issakadze; vocalists Irina Arkhipova, Katia Ricciarelli, Alla Ablaberdyeva, and others. The ensemble has
        collaborated with such renowned conductors as Rudolf Barshai, Gennady Provatorov, Vitaliy Kataev, Petr
        Vandilovsky, Dmitri Zubov, Mikhail Katz, Valeriy Polyansky, Alexander Polianichko, Ingo E.Rheil (Germany),
        Saulius Sondeckis (Lithuania) and others.</p>
    <p>The orchestra&#8217;s repertoire is multifaceted and extensive, ranging from the 17th century to the 21st. BelSCO
        became a unique creative laboratory for many Belarusian composers, including Smolsky, Kondrusevich, Kopytsko,
        Soltan, Gorelova among others. The ensemble has performed and recorded practically every piece of music composed
        by Belarusian composers.</p>
    <p>Currently, the orchestra is comprised of former graduates of Belorussian and Moscow Conservatories.<br />
        Among them are five winners of national and international competitions; six performers hold master&#8217;s and
        doctoral degrees from Belarusian Academy of Music; five more also teach in colleges and conservatories.</p>
